# A (Messy) Collection of Personal Math Notes #

## Content ##
This notes combine what I think is worth taking a note. Currently it consists mostly of notes taken while I am reading <<数学分析新讲>>, but is not limited to it.

## Compilation ##
1. Compile with `xelatex`. Proprietary fonts may be replaced as you wish.
2. The `files/` directory contains images and pdfs of corresponding topic.
